# Ludum Dare 30

This is my Game entry for [30th edition of the Ludum Dare competition][ld30].
It's a simple 2D space shooter called **B.O.W.** (for Black Or White), highly
inspired by the _Ikaruga_ game series.

This competitions theme was **Connected Worlds**.

## Comments

This was my second Ludum Dare and unfortunately I had a very busy
weekend. I could only spend like 5 hours making a game and this was
the final result.

I wanted to learn HaxelFlixel for quite some time and it was kinda
fun. Found a couple of tutorials and studied a lot of source code,
mostly from the examples on [HaxeFlixel website][haxeflixel].
